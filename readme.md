# Easy Client/Host (ECHo)

Easy to use TCP client / host library with callbacks and host migration to use for games or other applications.  
Only works on the CPP platform due to its use of multithreading.  

To get a better understanding of how this library is built and works, read the [manual here][94ea2a34]. (Will be transferred to github wiki at some point)

## License

It is MIT!
So... enjoy ;)
